# Movie Recommendation - ML Model
___
# Abstract
Content recommendation based on user activities has been used for years. Along with collaborative-based recommendation, that find similar user profiles and recommends the same content to both. I will be working on a content-based model. Recommending a movie based on an input of the movie you wish to find a similar movies to it. The data I am working with is [IMDb movies extensive dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset), it has been scraped from IMDb and provided by [Stefano Leone](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992). I will explore the important aspect of the data, build the model, and visualize some of the interesting findings.

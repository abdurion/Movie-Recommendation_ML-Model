# StackOverFlow Survey 2021

Stackoverflow is question and answer website that is tailored for professional and enthusiast programmers.

It is one of the websites of Stack Exchange Network along with Super User and Ask Ubuntu. It is without a doubt one of the most

helpful websites for any developers, as most of the common problems, has been answered already, or you could post a question and get

assistance for your problem.


StackOverFlow does a survey each year asking many questions to its users, about the age, job, salary, languages and frameworks.

I think there's a lot of insights you can discover from that survey. I would be looking into the most used languages and frameworks, along with

the job title, and salaries to help new developers have a better understanding of jobs and expectations of the industries.



The dataset I plan to use is the one provided by StackOverFlow for 2021 [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey), the survey contained 48 columns and 80k entries.

I expect to be working mostly on job titles, education, language and frameworks used in the past year.



I will be working with Pandas for EDA, I expect to also use Seaborn or matplotlab for visualization to make

the insights easier to perceive. The minimum viable product for this project would be a graph to represent the frameworks used in the user's job last year.

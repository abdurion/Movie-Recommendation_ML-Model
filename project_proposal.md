# Recommendation Model - IMDb Movies

### Overview
Content-based recommendation and collaborative-based recommendation are one of the most important models used in big corporate companies to boost their revenues or sales.



### Proposal
Netflix, Amazon and other big corporate uses this recommendation system and it is a big part of their business. My proposed project is building a system that recommends a movie, based on what the user likes. I will be using Content-based recommendations. The model I will be using is Cosine-similarity. As I understand, it is more efficient for text based and it is more appropriate as we do not care about the distance here but the similarity.
